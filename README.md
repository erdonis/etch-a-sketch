# etch-a-sketch

Fourth project in The Odin Project. Etch a Sketch is a website that allows users to make a sketch. Achieved that by creating a grid with squares and hovering over them. Added some functions to the website like the option to use an eraser, clear the grid, change the number of the cells and change the color of the "pen".

This project took a bit more time but was pretty fun to make.
